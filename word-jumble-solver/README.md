#Word Jumble Solver

This is a short code snippet that unscrambles a word or a bunch of words passed to it on the command line. It requires a dictionary file to run - it knows only the words contained in the file. The user then needs only to pass to the script any number of words, and the program will give all possible unscramblings of that word. Sample usage is shown below.
